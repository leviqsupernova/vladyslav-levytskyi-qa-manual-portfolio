# Mobile Apps Testing

![Qase projects overview](https://github.com/leviqsupernova/vladyslav-levytskyi-qa-manual-portfolio/blob/master/02_mobile_android/projects-overview.png)

This is real testing and bug reporting for three different Android apps in action, i.e. the tests found real defects.

The purpose is multimodal: to show my ability to use a third-party service for testing, that is [Qase.io](https://qase.io/), to diversify my portfolio with another type of testing and different domains, and show how I can find real failures. Nova Launcher and DRC bug reports were submitted to the developers; Domino's Pizza bug reports were not submitted, as I don't have the performance specifications, and the target load time was hypothetical. Though, the app always felt extremely sluggish; now I have the numbers :)

[Qase.io](https://qase.io/) was used instead of [TestRail.com](https://www.testrail.com/) simply to gain more experience with another test management tool.

Due to the scope and natural limitations, an ad hoc approach was used.

The artifacts were exported directly from [Qase.io](https://qase.io/); the bug report had only a .csv format available for export, hence, after converting it to .pdf, the report looks especially bland and misses critical information. For proper evaluation of my bug reporting skill, refer to [02_web_firefox](https://github.com/leviqsupernova/vladyslav-levytskyi-qa-manual-portfolio/tree/master/01_web_firefox).

I considered equivalence partitioning and boundary value techniques for demonstration, but I specifically wanted to reliably find failures within a reasonable amount of time.
