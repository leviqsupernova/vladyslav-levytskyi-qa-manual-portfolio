# Demo Testware

This directory contains hypothetical QA artifacts in relation to Fooyin Player, a Linux audio player similar to Windows' Foobar Player. This is only an exercise to showcase my ability to plan, report, and monitor QA processes.

The artifacts are: a test plan, test completion report, checklist, and traceability matrix. The corresponding test cases and bug reports were omitted, since they are already extensively introduced [here](https://github.com/leviqsupernova/vladyslav-levytskyi-qa-manual-portfolio/tree/master/02_mobile_android) and [here](https://github.com/leviqsupernova/vladyslav-levytskyi-qa-manual-portfolio/tree/master/01_web_firefox). Test progress reports, in my opinion, had a limited value in terms of demonstrating my skills compared to a possible time consumed, thus they were not included as well.

It should be noted that the format of such testware can vary greatly depending on the template used: a traceability matrix can be a simple one-page document or a detailed five-page report.
