# Demo Website Testing

![Demo Website](https://github.com/leviqsupernova/vladyslav-levytskyi-qa-manual-portfolio/blob/master/01_web_firefox/demo-website.png)

This project consists of simulated test runs and bug reporting based on my QA course website - [here](https://goitstudentsworks.github.io/js_70_melvinsz/).
 
The test runs (which can also serve as a demo of the previously deisgned test cases) and bug reports are hypothetical, as their purpose is to simply show my ability to create basic artifacts.
 
Nevertheless, the actual bugs were found and reported to the mentor in a free form. They can be provided upon your request.
