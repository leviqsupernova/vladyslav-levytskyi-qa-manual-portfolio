# QA Portfolio

The portfolio consists of three projects: a website testing, mobile apps testing, and API testing/investigation project.

The testware is representative of my real skills. This can be verified in a controlled environment without external sources.

The testware is partially based on a QA course materials, but mostly on my own research and understanding of software development fundamentals and testing concepts. I acknowledge the actual format and granularity are subject to change depending on the company’s workflow.

My English command is representative of my real writing skills (C1+). This can be verified in a controlled environment without external sources.
